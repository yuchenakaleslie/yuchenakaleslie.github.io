### Secondment

- 2022 Jan - June, <a href="https://www.isterre.fr/">Isterre</a>, <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA)</a>, France. 

During which I embarked on a collaboration work (underway) with Prof. Philippe Guéguen in the study [uncertainty-informed approach for structural damage detection with envrionmental factors]({% link _projects/5_project.md %}).

### Trainings

> I have taken part in trainings themed around `Probabilsitic Machine Learning`, `Uncertainty quantification`, `Imprecise probability`.
