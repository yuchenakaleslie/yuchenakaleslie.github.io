a.k.a Leslie, I'm currently a <u>postdoctoral researcher </u> at <a href='https://riskinstitute.uk'>Institute for Risk and Unceratinty, University of Liverpool</a>, working at an intersection of ***uncertainty quantification*** and ***deep learning*** with a focus on ***probability bounds analysis***.

I've got my PhD on the subject of *Modeling and dealing with vague and sparse information using Machine Learning*, funded by the EU-Horizon 2020 & Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions project <a href="https://urbasis-eu.osug.fr">URBASIS</a> as an <u>ESR</u>. 

I am dedicated to developing robust Deep Learning-based computational frameworks against **data problems** (imprecise, limited, scarce, imbalanced or OOD data), and propagating associated uncertainty through computational probabilistic models in an efficient way. My contribution revolves around two aspects: `(I)` equiping DL models with uncertainty awareness, allowing for **robustness**; `(II)` incorporating DL with prior (physical) domain knowledge, allowing for **fusion of knowledge**.
